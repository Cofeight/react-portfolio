                Originally from California, I have lived in Seattle for the past 7 years. My previous work
                experience has been quite varied, and I enjoy finding new and challenging opportunities to utilize
                critical thinking, implement collaborative processes, and continue to seek environments where I can
                grow personally and professionally. One of my favorite hobbies is international travel, and I look
                forward to the day where I can combine my passion for technology and travel into a rewarding and
                enriching career.
